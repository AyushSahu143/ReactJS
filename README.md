# React Learning Monorepo ⚛️

This repository documents my **React learning journey**, focused on building real understanding through **code, experimentation, and projects**.

Instead of collecting tutorials, this repo is about:
- writing code daily
- breaking things intentionally
- fixing them with understanding
- and improving through clean commits
